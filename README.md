# HMHO
Heuristic Metropolis-Hastings Optimization Algorithm (HMHO)

Overview

This project provides a Python-based implementation for optimizing protein sequences using Metropolis optimization and external tools like ProteinMPNN and NetSolP. The code allows for the design and analysis of protein sequences, improving their physical properties such as stability and resolution.

Features

ProteinMPNN Integration: Generate protein sequences with specific fixed positions.

NetSolP Integration: Calculate resolution of protein sequences using a deep learning model.

Metropolis Optimization: Iteratively refine sequences to improve biophysical properties.

Sequence Analysis: Evaluate sequence instability and flexibility.

Requirements

The project relies on the following dependencies:
